This file explains how to install the application on UNIX systems.

To compile and install the application run:
qmake
make
make install

Default installation prefix is /opt/F1LT. The following directory structure will be created after installation:

- executable file:
/opt/F1LT/bin/F1LT

- data files:
/opt/F1LT/share/season.dat
/opt/F1LT/share/trackrecords.dat
/opt/F1LT/share/trackdata.dat

Because trackrecords.dat file is updated after every session, a copy of this file is created in $HOME/.config/f1lt directory after first running of the program. Application reads data from and stores records into this copy (the original trackrecords.dat file is read only after first installation), so when you update the program, you will not loose your records.

Installation prefix can be set in F1LT.pro file - modify the following variables:

PREFIX = /opt/$$TARGET
SHARE = $$PREFIX/share

where $$TARGET points to F1LT.

If you want to install the program files to, for example /usr/local/bin and /usr/local/share/F1LT, change the above variables as follows:
PREFIX = /usr/local
SHARE=$$PREFIX/share/$$TARGET


!!WARNING!!
When running `make uninstall`, the whole $$PREFIX/bin and $$SHARE directories will be removed! Use this very carefully.
