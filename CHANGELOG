- head to head and lap time comparison charts now use default driver colors
- default driver colors are automatically adjusted using main colors of their cars; they can be also adjusted manually

- added .lt files database connected to the online server - it is now possible to get the access to online .lt files from the application

- for all "driver tools", that is - follow a driver, head 2 head and lap time comparison, data of the current driver, selected in the main view, is automatically loaded and displayed whenever one of those tools is launched
- quali results can now be sorted out by the selected quali part - first click on an appropriate column (Q1, Q2 or Q3) will sort the results using appropriate lap times, second click will trigger display time gaps to the leader instead of lap times, third click restores the original view
